In this three-server web infrastructure hosting www.foobar.com, security, encryption, and monitoring are paramount. We've implemented the following enhancements:
3 Firewalls: These firewalls bolster security by ensuring a client's request for information from a server undergoes rigorous scrutiny.

1 SSL Certificate: To serve www.foobar.com Over HTTPS, Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) ensures the encryption of data transmitted between users and the server, providing data integrity and authentication.

3 Monitoring Clients: Monitoring is essential for tracking resource performance, including servers, applications, and databases. It monitors CPU and memory usage, response times, storage availability, hardware health, and system logs to identify security risks and ensure a positive user experience.

SSL (Secure Sockets Layer)
SSL is a protocol that facilitates secure communication over a computer network. It provides encryption, data integrity, and authentication, safeguarding data transmitted between users and servers.

SERVING OVER HTTPS
Serving over HTTPS is crucial for several reasons related to security, including data encryption, data integrity, and user privacy.

MONITORING
Monitoring involves tracking resource performance, system health, and security. It ensures resources are available, and operational, and provides quick alerts in case of issues. Monitoring also identifies security threats by analyzing system logs and patterns.

Real-Life Monitoring
In practice, various tools and components like Nagios and Zabbix are used to collect data from different components of an IT infrastructure. Larger IT environments often use a centralized monitoring server as a control center for analysis and alerting.

QUERY PER SECOND (QPS)
QPS measures the rate at which queries or requests are made to a system per second.

MONITORING THE QPS OF A WEB-SERVER
Monitoring the QPS of a web server helps gauge its capacity to handle HTTP requests per second, providing insights into performance and resource utilization. Tools like Nagios and Zabbix can monitor QPS.

ISSUES
HAVING ONE MYSQL SERVER THAT ACCEPTS WRITES
While an architecture with high availability and fault tolerance offers distributed read traffic and backup capabilities, it can be complex and introduce delays. Having only one server that accepts writes may lead to overwhelming write requests.

ALL THE SERVERS HAVE THE SAME COMPONENTS
In this architecture, component failures can affect other servers. Specialization is lacking, resulting in under-utilization of resources. For example, a bug in the primary database can impact all replicas.
